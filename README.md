# Neural style transfer with deep convolutional network


## Description

This notebook contains the deep convolutiona neural network capable to make the neural style transfer between two images. It develops on existing VGG neural network and uses the altered loss function to generate the novel images. The original network could be found: https://www.kaggle.com/teksab/imagenetvggverydeep19mat#imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19.mat It has been developed as a part of the course deeplearning.ai The notebook contains the code and explanations.
